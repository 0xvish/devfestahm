The kind of solutions I can design could be for a desktop application, portables or any other medium that can benefit from the user experience I designed. I have deep understanding about the web architecture and consider my self a specialist in portable/mobile design solutions (for android). With an obsession to produce high performance apps that have a unique experience and still work without crashing or launching in most extreme hardware configurations. My association with creativity has been since childhood when I used to click photographs and even won numerous awards for various creative showcases overtime. That interest later developed into a more profound Degree in Visual Effects and Motion graphics from a top film college in United Kingdom. Even then I impressed my lecturers and peers with my creativity and skill-set and went on to win biggest student film and visual effects award of UK sponsored by Cinefex magazine/presented by Oscar Winner vfx supervisor Paul Franklin.",
